              <p class="card-text">Sercan graduated from Ankara University in 1983 with a degree in biomedical engineering. After 32 years as a biomedical engineer, Sercan became fascinated with the agricultural industry. Concerned with Turkey's waste problems and the warming of the planet, Sercan was determined to find sustainable solutions. After many months of research, Sercan, using his engineering skills, developed a greenhouse vermicomposting system. This system is automated in a fashion that gathers waste from farms and uses worms to decompose and create an organic compost that can be reused for many agricultural purposes. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> Ali graduated from Ankara University with an MD in 1984. Spending his professional career as a Pediatrician in North Carolina, Ali was ready to take on new projects. With the help of his childhood friend Sercan, Ali became interested in finding sustainable solutions to waste. After researching researching different decomposing organisms, Ali found that Black Soldier Flies are very effective at decomposing material and becoming organic fish feed. Together, with Sercan, they founded Germina to combine their ideas and continue to develop projects that are environmentally friendly.</p>
